# style_scraper
Webscraper for the Best of Style Weekly from 2011-2013

Set up a MySql database first - then update scrape_style.py with your credentials and run! Will definitely break if they've reformatted their site at all since I wrote this.

((If I were writing this now, I'd swap out MySQL for sqlite and use SQLAlchemy instead of hardcoded SQL text, but here we are))







TODO - Rewrite the 'API' with Flask . Find (and presumably fix) the Google Maps version that displays the data.
